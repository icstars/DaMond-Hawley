    More about me
</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        My day starts with a quick shower,
        and then a
        prayer in my "war room." <br> 
        Some mornings I hit the gym first, depending on the previous day's workout. <br>
         At work/school, I am attentive and aware and during lunch, I find a quiet spot for a quick Bible study. <br>
          After school, I take my dog out, grab a snack, then either hit the gym with my girl or do some chores. <br>
           My night ends with a shower, my intimate time with God, and then a call to my girlfriend before I catch some rest.

    Inspirastional figures
 </h4>

 <p>
    This cross has deep meaning, it's everything to me. <br>
     It represents the sacrifice Jesus made so I could have a relationship with God, which is the most important thing in my life. <br>
      Every day, it reminds me to take my cross up, deny my flesh, and walk in His spirit. <br>
       This cross deeply inspires me to live more like Jesus, striving to reflect His love everywhere I go, and in everything I do.

    My queen, Moriah, inspires me daily. <br>
     She pushes me to grow whether it's through patience or chasing my dreams. <br>
     She reflects a true woman of God, inspiring me to be my best spiritually, mentally, and emotionally, that way we can remain equally yoked.
