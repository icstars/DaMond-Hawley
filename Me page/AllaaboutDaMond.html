<p>
    My name is DaMond Hawley, I’m 23. Born in Salina, KS, but raised here in KCMO. <br>
     I grew up with a single mother raising four kids until my dad's release from prison when I was 8. <br>
      Moving to Liberty, MO, was a culture shock as one of the few black and low income kids in school. <br>
       I graduated in 2019 and later found my path in HVAC, where I got to travel the nation for 3 years before <br> realizing I wanted to be a “hands on” future husband and father. <br>
        Which is the main reason I am here with I.C.stars today.
